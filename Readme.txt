HW3 had many implementations and I was able to implent all fully except 
for animation due to time constraints. Animation currently displays the 
image view of a yellow ball and the correct light blue background and nothing else.
All other methods work and save state on orientation mode. For speech text and 
text speech I used the methods described in lecture. For comic I created a class with 
methods to allow for zoom and drag capabilities. For when 0 is entered in comic I considered it 
an out of range case. Also some images take up the complete size of the screen and some can be 
scaled down when the orientation is vertical. On horizontal orientation the scaling has some bugs but
they are very minor. The video implementation uses 
the implementation from the StackOverflow provided by the proffessor. I will be using one more late
day for this assigment.
